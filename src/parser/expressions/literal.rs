/// A "literal object". Literal objects can be thought of as simple associative arrays, similar to a JSON object or similar.
/// Specifically, a literal object is a collection of fields where each field's value is another literal object.
///
/// You may notice that there's no `LiteralObject` variant of `Expression`. This is because literal objects live in "virtual memory",
/// and instead we refer to them with "virtual pointers" via the `Pointer` struct. You can read more about this in the documentation
/// for `VirtualMemory` and `context.virtual_memory`.
///
/// `LiteralObjects` are equivalent to types in Cabin. Cabin allows arbitrary expressions to be used as types, as long as "the entire
/// expression can be evaluated at compile-time" which just means that it can be evaluated down to a `LiteralObject`. If you want to
/// check or ensure that an expression is a type, check if it's a pointer to a `LiteralObject`.
///
/// Many constructs in Cabin are stored as `LiteralObject` that you might not expect. For example, all group declarations, either declarations,
/// function declarations, and one-of declarations are stored as literal objects. That's because at their core, all information about them is
/// known at compile-time. Any such object should be stored as a `LiteralObject`. Read the documentation on the `LiteralConvertible` trait for
/// more information about how these types of syntaxes are stored as and retrieved from `LiteralObjects`.

pub trait LiteralConvertible: Sized {
	/// Attempts to serialize `self` into a literal object.
	///
	/// For example, consider a `FunctionDeclaration`. Function declarations are their own struct with their own
	/// type information (return type, parameters, etc.), but within the language, they're just objects like everything
	/// else. They interact just like objects, meaning you can access fields on them, pass them as values, etc. For this
	/// reason, it's often helpful to be able to convert a type-safe function declaration object into a generic Cabin
	/// object; For example, the compiler's virtual memory only stores `LiteralObjects`, so to store a function declaration
	/// in memory, it needs to be converted first.
	///
	/// The reverse of this method is `from_literal`, which exists for all types that implement this method, `to_literal`.
	/// This is used, for example, to retrieve a function declaration as a type-safe instance of `FunctionDeclaration` from
	/// the compiler's virtual memory. Together, these two functions allow storing and retrieving arbitrary types in virtual
	/// memory.
	///
	/// This function is generally called at the very end of compile-time evaluation in a type's implementation of
	/// `evaluate_at_compile_time` from the `CompileTime` trait. This is when literals should be stored in virtual memory,
	/// and such types should return a pointer to that location in virtual memory from their compile-time evaluation method.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `context` - Global data about the current state of the compiler. For this function in particular, implementors may
	/// find use out of the context by being able to access the program's scopes, which is how `Name`s are resolved, among
	/// other things.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// The literal object that this was converted to, or an error if there was an error while attempting to convert this
	/// to a literal object. This could be, for example, that a value that should be a literal isn't; Such as the case of a
	/// user using an expression as a type when that expression can't be fully evaluated at compile-time.
	fn to_literal(self) -> LiteralObject;

	/// Attempts to deserialize a literal object into `Self`.
	///
	/// For example, consider a `FunctionDeclaration`. Function declarations are their own struct with their own
	/// type information (return type, parameters, etc.), but they're serialized as literals with `to_literal` to be
	/// stored in virtual memory. Thus, when we want to retrieve information about the function declaration (such as
	/// when calling the function), we need to be able to deserialize the literal object back into a type-safe function
	/// declaration.
	///
	/// Note that this function takes a reference to a literal object, but returns an owned instance of `Self`. It may involve
	/// cloning. This is because literal objects are owned by virtual memory, and currently nothing can be moved out of virtual
	/// memory. Additionally, this function can't receive a mutable reference to a literal object, because any borrow of a literal
	/// object is indirectly a borrow of the compiler's `context`, and then `context` couldn't be passed to this function at all
	/// because only one mutable reference of it can exist at a time, which would be taken up by the borrow to the literal.
	///
	/// When this function is called depends on the specific type that's implementing it. For example, function declarations
	/// get deserialized during function calls, but group declarations get deserialized during object construction.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `context` - Global data about the current state of the compiler. For this function in particular, implementors may
	/// find use out of the context by being able to access the program's scopes, which is how `Name`s are resolved, among
	/// other things.
