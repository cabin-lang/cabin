	/// substitutions it would take to get from one string to another.
	///
	/// This is used to get the "closest variables" to a given name - when the developer attempts to reference a variable that
	/// doesn't exist, the compiler suggests the closest ones.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	/// - `other` - The other string to get the distance to, relative to this string.
	///
	/// # Returns
	/// The numerical "distance" from this string to the other string. This result is commutative, so `s1.distance_to(s2)` is
	/// exactly equivalent to `s2.distance_to(s1)` in result. The greater the result, the further apart the strings are. Two
	/// equivalent strings will always return 0.
